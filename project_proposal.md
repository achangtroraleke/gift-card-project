# Project Proposal

Use this template to help get you started right away! Once the proposal is complete, please let your mentor know that this is ready to be reviewed.

## Get Started

|            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The Gift Card Web app is a solution for any small business to keep track of deferred revenue liability without having to commit to a Point of Sale company. Companies, such as Toast, UberEats, Doordash, offer this service as a premium feature with their service, after you have committed to using their payment system. So not only do small businesses have to pay the monthly fees of the agreement, but they must pay extra for these features they’ve already had. With the help of the Gift Card web app, a business can issue paper vouchers or certificates to consumers just as they used to, but the cards are now on record for the employee to redeem for them. Saving businesses hundreds of dollars every month. |

| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.                               | I chose Django for its built-in authentication and its html templates. Since the emphasis is on data storage the focus of this project would be on the backend      |
| Type       | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   This will be a web app for small businesses to use.    |
| Goal       | What goal will your project be designed to achieve?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The goal of this app is to provide a more affordable way for small business to have a gift card system without transition to an online record keeping system.        |
| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | My users will mostly be business owners        |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. |         |
My data would mostly be gift card activity. 
# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name                   | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design Database schema      | Determine the models and database schema required for your project.                                           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/1) |
| Source Your Data            | Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/2) |
| User Flows                  | Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a user’s experience to be like as they navigate your site. | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/3) |
| Set up backend and database | Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.        | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/4) |
| Set up frontend             | Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.            | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/5) |
| User Authentication         | Fullstack feature - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user                                     | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/6) |

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Stretch Goal      |
