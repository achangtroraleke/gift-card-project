Capstone Project Proposal

## Proposal 1 (“Gift card webapp”) **preferred project **
This project aims to solve the problem that small businesses face during the holiday season. The web application allows a business to store gift card data locally on their machine, without having to require internet connection. Within the site, a user can keep track of voucher or gift cards sold. Those cards can later be redeemed manually on the website, and transactions would be logged under that card.
Potential API
Twilio for email receipts

## Proposal 2 (Beverage Portioner)
This web application improves the efficiency of portioning out ingredients for a cocktail. It provides a centralized location to look up trusted recipes for cocktails along with the ingredient portions for the desired number of drinks.

## Proposal 3 (Stock News)
This web application will measure the effects of news articles on a stock. The website would take note of the opening and closing prices of a stock and related media that day and compare the changes in price. It would indicate a major change when a certain change threshold was reached.
